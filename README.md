## Description
Hector's Minigames is a vast array of 3 minigames that will be sure to entertain anyones day! The main aim of this project was to push the boundaries of what minigames
could be and moving beyond it to make something that multiple people can play.

## Games.

### Hangman.
This game was our starter game which also employs the basic hangman. We mainly used arrays in this project then the random module to generate words and splice arrays
to give the hangman feel.

### Pong.
This game is a basic intonation of the iconic game pong and we mainly used python to code this and the pygame module mostly.

### Bee Game
This game was mainly used to really break the boundaries of what we wanted to do. We decided to make an all out shooter game for our project and really test the boundaries
of a multitude of for loops and while loops, while employing various aspects of pygame.
